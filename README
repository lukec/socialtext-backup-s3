How to use this:

Put the following in the www-data user's crontab:

  12 17 * * * PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin/st-backup-s3 >> /var/log/st-backup-s3.log

And then make sure that `/var/log/st-backup-s3.log` exists and is writable by the www-data user.

Configuration:

Create a `/etc/socialtext/backup-s3.yaml` file with this format:

    # Put your amazon details here
    aws_access_key_id: 0O0O0O00O0O0O0O0O0O0
    aws_secret_access_key: 0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O0O

And then it should work.  You can check what it's doing by reading the code and the log file.
